## Technical Implementation Details

### Archive Restoration Implementation

```go
// Key methods implemented:

```

**Features:**

- Soroban meta `RestoredFootprint` analysis
- Contract ID and storage key extraction

### Data Source Determination Logic

```go
// Implementation:

- hasRestoredChanges(changes) -> bool
```

**Decision Factors:**
- Ledger meta version and content analysis
- Evicted entry presence in LedgerCloseMetaV2
- Transaction meta restoration patterns
- Archive activity correlation

### Advanced Event Extraction

#### Diagnostic Events
```go

```go
- extractStateChanges(tx, opIndex) -> []*StateChange
- processLedgerEntryChangeForState(change) -> *StateChange
- createStateChange(contractData, oldVal, newVal, op) -> *StateChange
```

#### Contract-to-Contract Calls
```go
- extractContractCalls(tx, opIndex) -> []*ContractToContractCall
- extractSubCallsFromReturnValue(returnVal, tx) -> []*ContractToContractCall
