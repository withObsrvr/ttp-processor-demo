client := cipb.NewContractInvocationServiceClient(conn)
req := &cipb.GetInvocationsRequest{
    StartLedger: 1000000,
    ContractIds: []string{"CCWW..."},
    SuccessfulOnly: true,
}
stream, err := client.GetContractInvocations(context.Background(), req)
```

```javascript
// Node.js consumer example
const request = {
    startLedger: 1000000,
    contractIds: ['CCWW...'],
    successfulOnly: true
};
const stream = client.getContractInvocations(request);
```
