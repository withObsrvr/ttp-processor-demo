# Contract Data Processor - Implementation Plan (COMPLETED)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan that was successfully executed to restore full functionality to the contract data processor after encountering API compatibility issues with stellar/go, Apache Arrow Flight, and flowctl proto definitions.

## Initial State

The processor had compilation errors due to:
1. Missing fields in stellar/go's `ContractDataOutput` struct
2. Apache Arrow Flight API changes in v17
3. Flowctl proto definition mismatches
4. Method signature incompatibilities

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Contract Data Field Extraction (COMPLETED) ✅

**Goal**: Extract all contract data fields including Key, Val, KeyXdr, ValXdr, and contract-specific metadata

**What Was Done**:
1. Modified `convertToEntry` to access raw ledger entries via `change.Post.Data.MustContractData()`
2. Extracted Key and Val ScVals directly from XDR
3. Implemented base64 encoding for XDR fields
4. Added contract instance detection and WASM hash extraction
5. Implemented asset contract ID calculation using stellar/go methods

**Key Code Changes**:
```go
// Extract Key and Val from the raw ledger entry
if change.Post != nil && change.Post.Data.Type == xdr.LedgerEntryTypeContractData {
    contractDataEntry := change.Post.Data.MustContractData()
    entry.Key = contractDataEntry.Key
    entry.Val = contractDataEntry.Val
    
    // Encode to base64 XDR
    keyBytes, err := contractDataEntry.Key.MarshalBinary()
    if err == nil {
        entry.KeyXdr = base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(keyBytes)
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Apache Arrow Flight Server (COMPLETED) ✅

**Goal**: Update Arrow Flight server to work with the v17 API

**What Was Done**:
1. Updated server registration to use `flight.RegisterFlightServiceServer()`
2. Fixed RecordWriter creation with `ipc.WithSchema()`
3. Implemented proper streaming with writer creation on first record
4. Fixed method signatures (e.g., ListActions)
5. Added proper memory management with record.Release()

**Key Code Changes**:
```go
// Create writer on first record
if writer == nil {
    writer = flight.NewRecordWriter(stream, ipc.WithSchema(record.Schema()))
    defer writer.Close()
}
```

### Phase 3: Flowctl Integration (COMPLETED) ✅

**Goal**: Update flowctl integration to use new proto definitions

**What Was Done**:
1. Changed from complex request/response types to simple ServiceInfo/ServiceHeartbeat
2. Implemented graceful degradation with simulated service IDs
3. Added Prometheus metric updates
4. Used timestamppb for proper timestamp handling
5. Removed deprecated service status enums

**Key Code Changes**:
```go
info := &pb.ServiceInfo{
    ServiceType: pb.ServiceType_SERVICE_TYPE_PROCESSOR,
    InputEventTypes: []string{"raw_ledger_service.RawLedgerChunk"},
    OutputEventTypes: []string{"contract_data.ArrowBatch"},
    HealthEndpoint: fmt.Sprintf("http://localhost:%d/health", fc.config.HealthPort),
    MaxInflight: 1000,
}
```

## Architecture Patterns Applied

### 1. **Data Extraction Pattern** (from stellar/go processors)
- Direct access to XDR structures
- Type-safe extraction with error handling
- Proper encoding for storage/transmission

### 2. **Arrow Flight Pattern** (from stellar-arrow-source)
- gRPC-based server registration
- Schema-first record writing
- Proper memory lifecycle management

### 3. **Flowctl Pattern** (from stellar-live-source-datalake)
- Service registration with metadata
- Periodic heartbeats with metrics
- Graceful degradation on failures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Contract data extraction with various entry types
- XDR encoding/decoding verification
- Asset contract ID calculation

### Integration Tests
- Arrow Flight client connection
- Stream data verification
- Flowctl registration and heartbeats

### Performance Tests
- High-volume data processing
- Memory usage under load
- Network throughput optimization

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - `FLOWCTL_ENABLED`: Enable/disable control plane integration
   - `FLOWCTL_ENDPOINT`: Control plane address
   - `STELLAR_NETWORK`: Network configuration

2. **Resource Requirements**
   - Memory: 2-4GB recommended for high throughput
   - CPU: 4+ cores for parallel processing
   - Network: High bandwidth for Arrow Flight streaming

3. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus metrics on `:8089/metrics`
   - Health check on `:8089/health`
   - Flowctl dashboard for service status

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Evolution**: Always check for API changes when updating dependencies
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Services should continue operating even when optional components fail
3. **Pattern Reuse**: Leverage existing implementations in the codebase for consistency
4. **Type Safety**: Go's type system helped catch many issues at compile time

## Future Enhancements

1. **TTL Data Extraction**: Correlate with TTL entries for expiration data
2. **Dynamic Filtering**: Support runtime filter updates via Flight tickets
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement zero-copy Arrow transfers
4. **Extended Metrics**: Add more detailed processing statistics

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully restored all critical functionality while improving the codebase through:
- Better separation of concerns
- More robust error handling
- Consistent patterns across components
- Future-proof API usage

The contract data processor is now ready for production use with full observability and high-performance data streaming capabilities.
