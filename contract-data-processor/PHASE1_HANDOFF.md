# Phase 1 Developer Handoff - Contract Data Processor

## Phase 1 Summary: Core Infrastructure ✅

Phase 1 has been completed successfully. This phase established the foundational infrastructure for the contract data processor service, including project structure, dependencies, configuration management, and logging.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Project Structure
Created a well-organized directory structure following Go best practices:
```
contract-data-processor/
├── Makefile                    # Build automation
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
├── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md      # Detailed implementation roadmap
├── protos/
│   ├── contract_data_service.proto  # Service definitions
│   └── gen.sh                       # Proto generation script
├── go/
│   ├── go.mod                  # Go module definition
│   ├── main.go                 # Application entry point
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── config.go           # Configuration management
│   ├── logging/
│   │   └── logger.go           # Structured logging
│   ├── server/                 # (Ready for Phase 2)
│   ├── processor/              # (Ready for Phase 3)
│   └── schema/                 # (Ready for Phase 4)
└── consumer/
    └── postgresql/             # (Ready for Phase 6)
```

### 2. Build System (Makefile)
- **build**: Compiles the main processor
- **build-consumer**: Compiles the PostgreSQL consumer
- **gen-proto**: Generates Go code from protobuf definitions
- **run**: Builds and runs the processor
- **test**: Runs unit tests
- **clean**: Removes build artifacts
- Supports both processor and consumer builds

### 3. Dependencies (go.mod)
Configured all required dependencies:
- **stellar/go**: Official Stellar SDK for contract processing
- **apache/arrow/go/v17**: Apache Arrow for columnar data
- **grpc**: For service communication
- **lib/pq**: PostgreSQL driver
- **rs/zerolog**: Structured JSON logging
- **flowctl**: Control plane integration (with local replace)

### 4. Protocol Buffers
Defined the control plane interface in `contract_data_service.proto`:
- **GetServiceInfo**: Returns service capabilities and Arrow endpoint
- **GetStatus**: Provides processing metrics
- **GetFilterConfig/UpdateFilterConfig**: Manages data filtering
- Includes comprehensive message definitions for filters and status

Key design decision: Data plane uses Arrow Flight protocol directly (no protobuf needed).

### 5. Logging Infrastructure
Created a comprehensive logging package (`logging/logger.go`):
- Structured JSON logging with zerolog
- Component-aware logging with version tracking
- Specialized log methods for different scenarios:
  - `LogStartup()`: Service initialization
  - `LogProcessing()`: Ledger processing metrics
  - `LogStreaming()`: Arrow Flight streaming metrics
- Configurable log levels (debug/info/warn/error)
- Pretty console output for development

### 6. Configuration Management
Built a flexible configuration system (`config/config.go`):
- Environment variable based configuration
- Comprehensive settings for all service aspects:
  - Network configuration (passphrase, endpoints)
  - Server ports (gRPC, Arrow Flight, Health)
  - Processing parameters (batch size, memory limits)
  - Filtering options (contract IDs, assets, etc.)
  - Performance tuning (workers, buffers)
- Input validation to catch misconfigurations early
- CSV parsing for filter lists

### 7. Main Application Skeleton
Created `main.go` with:
- Configuration loading and validation
- Logger initialization
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- Context management for clean shutdowns
- TODOs marking integration points for next phases

### 8. Documentation
- **README.md**: Comprehensive service documentation
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Detailed roadmap for all phases
- Clear API documentation and examples
- Configuration reference

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Architecture
- **Control Plane**: Traditional gRPC for service management
- **Data Plane**: Apache Arrow Flight for high-performance streaming
- This separation allows optimal protocol choice for each use case

### 2. Configuration Strategy
- Environment variables for all settings (12-factor app)
- Sensible defaults for development
- Validation to catch errors early
- Structured configuration object for type safety

### 3. Logging Approach
- Structured JSON for machine parsing
- Human-readable console output for development
- Component and version tracking for distributed debugging
- Specialized metric logging methods

### 4. Error Handling Philosophy
- Early validation (config.Validate())
- Fail fast on startup for configuration errors
- Graceful degradation for runtime errors (coming in Phase 2)

## Ready for Phase 2

The infrastructure is now ready for Phase 2 implementation:

### What's Next (Phase 2 - Data Ingestion)
1. **gRPC Client**: Connect to stellar-live-source-datalake
2. **Stream Handler**: Process incoming raw ledgers
3. **Connection Management**: Handle disconnects/reconnects
4. **Health Checking**: Monitor upstream service
5. **Metrics**: Track ingestion rates

### Integration Points Prepared
- `main.go` has TODO markers for component integration
- Config system ready with `SourceEndpoint` settings
- Logger ready with `LogProcessing()` method
- Directory structure in place for server code

### How to Start Phase 2
1. Create `go/server/grpc_client.go` for upstream connection
2. Implement raw ledger stream consumer
3. Add connection lifecycle management
4. Integrate with existing logger and config
5. Update main.go to start the client

## Testing Phase 1

To verify Phase 1 infrastructure:

```bash
# 1. Generate protobuf code
cd protos && ./gen.sh

# 2. Download dependencies
cd ../go && go mod download

# 3. Build the service
cd .. && make build

# 4. Run with test configuration
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015" \
SOURCE_ENDPOINT="localhost:50053" \
./contract-data-processor
```

Expected output:
- Service starts successfully
- Configuration loads and validates
- Startup banner displays
- Waits for shutdown signal
- Gracefully shuts down on Ctrl+C

## Handoff Notes

### What Works
- Complete project structure
- Build system operational
- Configuration loading from environment
- Logging infrastructure ready
- Protobuf definitions complete
- Main application skeleton functional

### What's Missing (Intentionally)
- No actual data processing (Phase 2-3)
- No Arrow Flight server (Phase 5)
- No PostgreSQL consumer (Phase 6)
- No flowctl integration (Phase 7)

### Development Environment
- Requires Go 1.21+
- Protoc installed for proto generation
- PostgreSQL for consumer (Phase 6)
- Access to stellar-live-source-datalake

### Code Quality
- All code follows Go best practices
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented with comments
- Consistent naming conventions

## Conclusion

Phase 1 has successfully established a solid foundation for the contract data processor. The infrastructure is clean, well-organized, and ready for the implementation of core functionality in subsequent phases. The hybrid architecture design is clearly expressed in the code structure, with separation between control and data planes already evident.

The next developer can immediately begin Phase 2 with confidence, as all supporting infrastructure is in place and tested.
