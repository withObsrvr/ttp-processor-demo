# Phase 3 Developer Handoff: Analytics & Parquet Storage

## Overview

Phase 3 has been successfully implemented with the two essential features requested:
1. Real-time analytics engine for Arrow data
2. Parquet file storage for archival

## What Was Completed

### 1. Analytics Engine (analytics/engine.go)

- **Core Engine**: Processes Arrow records through configurable aggregations
- **Aggregation Types**: Sum, Average, Count, Min, Max, Distinct, Percentile, StdDev
- **Time Windows**: Sliding window analytics with configurable duration
- **Filtering**: Support for equals, not equals, greater than, less than operations
- **Grouping**: Group results by specified fields
- **TTP-Specific Analytics**: Payment volume analysis by asset

**Key Features**:
- Memory-efficient sliding window implementation
- Concurrent processing of multiple aggregations
- Real-time updates as data streams

**Limitations**:
- Simplified filter implementation (production would use Arrow compute kernels)
- Basic window management (keeps last 100 records instead of time-based)
- Compression not implemented in Parquet writer due to API changes

### 2. Parquet Storage (storage/parquet_writer.go)

- **File Writer**: Writes Arrow records to Parquet files
- **Partitioning**: Automatic partitioning by date or ledger range
- **File Rotation**: Rotates files based on size limits
- **Archiver**: Buffers records and writes periodically

**Key Features**:
- Configurable partitioning strategies
- Automatic file rotation at size limits
- Thread-safe concurrent writes
- Buffered archival for efficiency

### 3. Integration with Main Server

The main server (main.go) now:
- Initializes analytics engine if ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
- Creates Parquet writer if PARQUET_BASE_PATH is set
- Processes records through analytics in DoGet handler
- Archives records to Parquet automatically

### 4. Example Usage (examples/analytics_example.go)

Complete example showing:
- Setting up analytics aggregations
- Processing streaming data
- Writing to Parquet files
- Querying results

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Analytics
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true                    # Enable analytics engine
ANALYTICS_WINDOW_SIZE=1h                 # Window size for aggregations
ANALYTICS_BUFFER_SIZE=10000              # Buffer size for analytics

# Parquet Storage
PARQUET_BASE_PATH=/data/stellar-parquet  # Base directory for Parquet files
PARQUET_COMPRESSION=zstd                 # Compression type (currently using default)
PARQUET_MAX_FILE_SIZE=268435456          # Max file size before rotation (256MB)
PARQUET_PARTITION_FORMAT=2006/01/02      # Date format for partitioning
PARQUET_ARCHIVE_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5       # Archive interval in minutes
PARQUET_ARCHIVE_BUFFER_SIZE=1000         # Buffer size before flush
```

## Running with Phase 3 Features

```bash
# Start with analytics and Parquet enabled
MOCK_DATA=false \
SOURCE_ENDPOINT=localhost:50053 \
BATCH_SIZE=1 \
ARROW_PORT=8815 \
HEALTH_PORT=8089 \
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true \
PARQUET_BASE_PATH=./parquet-data \
./stellar-arrow-source
```

## Testing Phase 3 Features

1. **Test Analytics**:
   ```bash
   # Run the analytics example
   cd examples
   go run analytics_example.go
   ```

2. **Verify Parquet Files**:
   ```bash
   # Check created Parquet files
   ls -la ./parquet-data/
   
   # Use parquet-tools to inspect
   parquet-tools cat ./parquet-data/default/*.parquet
   ```

3. **Query with DuckDB**:
   ```sql
   -- Install DuckDB and query Parquet files
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM './parquet-data/default/*.parquet';
   ```

## Known Issues and Future Work

### Issues to Address

1. **Parquet Compression**: Currently using default compression. The Arrow v17 parquet API for compression needs proper implementation.

2. **Analytics Filters**: Simplified implementation. Should use Arrow compute kernels for better performance.

3. **Window Management**: Currently keeps last N records. Should implement proper time-based windowing.

### Future Enhancements

1. **More Analytics**:
   - Cross-asset payment flows
   - Account activity patterns
   - Network congestion metrics

2. **Parquet Improvements**:
   - Schema evolution support
   - Better partitioning strategies
   - Metadata storage

3. **Performance**:
   - Use Arrow compute kernels
   - Parallel aggregation processing
   - Memory-mapped Parquet reading

## Architecture Notes

### Analytics Engine Flow
```
Arrow Record → Filter → Window Buffer → Aggregation → Results
                ↓
         Parquet Archiver → Parquet Files
```

### Parquet Storage Structure
```
parquet-data/
├── 2024/01/15/     # Date-based partitions
│   ├── data_20240115_140523.parquet
│   └── data_20240115_141023.parquet
└── default/        # Fallback partition
    └── data_20240115_142000.parquet
```

## API Usage

### Creating Analytics Aggregation
```go
engine := analytics.NewAnalyticsEngine(allocator, logger)

agg, err := engine.CreateAggregation(
    "payment_volume",
    analytics.AggregationSum,
    time.Hour,
    []string{"asset_code"},
    []analytics.Filter{
        {Field: "amount", Operator: analytics.FilterGreaterThan, Value: int64(1000000)},
    },
)
```

### Writing to Parquet
```go
writer, err := storage.NewParquetWriter(config, allocator, logger)
err = writer.WriteRecord(ctx, arrowRecord, metadata)
```

## Monitoring

- Analytics metrics available at `/metrics` endpoint
- Parquet write statistics in logs
- Health check includes analytics status

## Summary

Phase 3 successfully adds real-time analytics and Parquet storage to the Arrow-native Stellar data pipeline. The implementation is production-ready for basic use cases, with clear paths for enhancement as customer requirements evolve.

The system now supports:
- Real-time payment volume analysis
- Historical data archival in Parquet format
- SQL-queryable data for business intelligence
- Efficient columnar storage with Arrow

This provides immediate value for analytics use cases while keeping the architecture simple and maintainable.
