# Cycle 3 Progress: Operations + Native Balances

**Appetite**: 2 weeks (10 working days)
**Started**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Days 1-2 Complete ‚úÖ

---

## ‚úÖ Completed (Days 1-2)

### Schema Research & Definition

**1. Complete Operations Schema Documentation** ‚úÖ
- File: `OPERATIONS_SCHEMA.md`
- Researched stellar-etl, Horizon API, and stellar/go SDK
- Documented all 24 operation types
- Defined ~103 total fields:
  - 12 common fields (all operations)
  - 91 type-specific fields (varies by type)
- Natural keys: `transaction_hash + operation_index`
  - **Fixes synthetic ID problem** reported by Discord user (esteblock)

**2. Complete SQL DDL** ‚úÖ
- File: `operations_schema.sql` (428 lines)
- CREATE TABLE with all 103 fields
- Basic indexes for query optimization
- Comprehensive comments and documentation

**3. Native Balances Schema** ‚úÖ
- File: `native_balances_schema.sql` (94 lines)
- 11 fields for XLM balance tracking
- Similar to account_balances (Cycle 2) but for native XLM
- Includes liabilities, subentries, sponsorship fields

## üéØ Next Steps (Days 3-5)

### Core Operations Implementation

**High Priority (Must Have):**
1. Add OperationData struct to main.go (103 fields)
2. Add NativeBalanceData struct to main.go (11 fields)
3. Implement extractOperations() function
4. Implement extraction for:
   - Payment (3 types): Payment, PathPaymentStrictSend, PathPaymentStrictReceive
   - Account (2 types): CreateAccount, AccountMerge
   - DEX (2 types): ManageBuyOffer, ManageSellOffer
   - Trust (2 types): ChangeTrust, AllowTrust

**Total**: 9 operation types in Days 3-5

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Must Have
- ‚úÖ Complete schema defined (103 fields for operations, 11 for native balances)
- [ ] 9 operation types extracting correctly
- [ ] Native XLM balances working
- [ ] transaction_hash FK working (fixes synthetic ID problem)
- [ ] All JOINs working (ledgers ‚Üí transactions ‚Üí operations)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Additional operation types (Claimable Balance, Soroban)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Query performance analysis

## üìù Notes

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Natural Keys**: Using `transaction_hash + operation_index` instead of synthetic IDs
   - Fixes Discord user complaint about stellar-etl
   - More reliable JOINs

2. **Schema-Complete Approach**: Define all fields now, implement incrementally
   - Avoids reingestion (Parquet immutability)
   - Can add extraction logic in future cycles without schema changes

3. **Single Table**: All operation types in one table
   - Most fields NULL for any given operation
   - Better than 24 separate tables (simpler queries, easier maintenance)

**Discoveries:**
- Stellar has 24 distinct operation types (as of Protocol 23)
- Most complex: SetOptions (15 type-specific fields), InvokeHostFunction (12 fields)
- Payment operations are most common (user need #1 from Discord)

**User Needs (Discord):**
1. esteblock (Soroswap): Reliable transaction_hash FK ‚úÖ Addressed
2. Jake (SDF/Freighter): Payment + DEX tracking ‚úÖ Prioritized
3. SDF Labs: Contract invocation tracking ‚Üí Cycle 4
