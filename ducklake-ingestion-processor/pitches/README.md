# Pitch Library

This directory contains **shaped pitches** - options for future cycles, **not a backlog**.

## Key Principles

1. **Pitches are options**, not commitments
2. **Bet on ONE** pitch per cycle (or bet on nothing)
3. **Shape during cool-down**, bet at start of cycle
4. **Pitches can be rejected** - that's healthy
5. **New problems** can become pitches anytime

## Current Pitches

### Ready to Bet
- `PITCH_TRANSACTION_QUERY.md` - Add transactions table (1 week appetite)

### Raw Ideas (Not Shaped Yet)
- Soroban contract events
- Payment processing
- Performance optimization
- Backfill automation

### Rejected/Parked
- _(none yet)_

## Betting Process

**After each cool-down**:

1. **Review pitches** in this directory
2. **Ask**: What's the most valuable problem to solve?
3. **Pick ONE** (or pick nothing)
4. **Set clear appetite** (1 week, 2 weeks, etc.)
5. **Work the bet** until deadline
6. **Ship or kill** - never extend

## Shaping New Pitches

When you have an idea:

1. **Write the problem** (what itch needs scratching?)
2. **Set an appetite** (how much time is it worth?)
3. **Sketch solution** (fat marker, not detailed)
4. **Mark rabbit holes** (what NOT to do)
5. **Define done** (concrete success example)
6. **Save as pitch** (don't start building yet!)

## Template

See `PITCH_TRANSACTION_QUERY.md` for the template.

Key sections:
- Problem (why now?)
- Appetite (time budget)
- Solution (rough sketch)
- Rabbit Holes (scope limiters)
- No-Gos (explicitly out)
- Done Looks Like (demo)
- Scope Line (must/nice/could)
- Betting Criteria (when to pick this)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't**:
- Treat pitches as a todo list
- Work on multiple pitches at once
- Feel obligated to build every pitch
- Shape too detailed (that's planning)
- Skip cool-down to "get ahead"

✅ **Do**:
- Shape loosely during cool-down
- Bet on one thing at a time
- Kill pitches that lose relevance
- Cut scope, not time
- Ship on deadline
